### macOS speech recognition via the command line

`hear` is a command line interface for the built-in speech recognition capabilities in macOS.
This makes it possible to transcribe spoken audio input or entire audio files.

Apple's macOS has long shipped with the `say` tool, a command line interface
for the operating system's venerable speech synthesis capabilities. As of
10.15 "Catalina", it also ships with highly capable speech recognition for a variety
of languages. This project is an attempt to provide a robust native CLI for this functionality
since no such tool is provided by Apple. `hear` supports speech recognition and
transcription of both live microphone input and audio files in a variety of formats. 
All formats supported by CoreAudio should work (e.g. WAV, MP3, AIFF, AAC, CAF, ALAC, etc.).

See the [man page](https://sveinbjorn.org/files/manpages/hear.1.html) for further details.

(Intel/ARM 64-bit, macOS 10.15 or later, ~50 KB)

## Installation

After downloading and expanding the archive, change to the resulting directory and run
the following command:

```
bash install.sh
```

This will install the binary into `/usr/local/bin` and the man page into
`/usr/local/share/man/man1/`.

## Usage

### Transcribe audio from microphone (or default audio input device)

```
hear
```

### From microphone in single line output mode

```
hear -m
```

### Transcribe audio file

```
hear -d -i /path/to/someone_speaking.wav > transcribed_text.txt
```

The `-d` flag specifies that only on-device speech recognition capabilities
should be used. Otherwise, data may be sent to Apple servers, which as of 
writing (2025) have a hard limit of about 500 characters before quitting.

## Build

To build `hear` from source, run the following command from the repository root (requires Xcode command line build tools):

```
make build_unsigned
```

The resulting binary is created in `products/`.

## Test

To run tests on the built command line tool, execute the following command from the repository root:

```
bash test/test.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

If running the binary leads to an abort signal, try running the binary by right-clicking, and selecting open. This should automatically open the binary with the regular terminal and prompt you to allow the required permissions.
